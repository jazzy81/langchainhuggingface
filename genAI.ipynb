              "'?\\n\\nMachine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms use data to learn and identify patterns and trends, and then use that knowledge to make decisions or predictions based on new data. This approach enables machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as image and speech recognition, language translation, and predictive analysis.\\n\\nMachine learning algorithms can be categorized based on their approach to learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning the data comes with known inputs and outputs. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs by finding the underlying relationship between them. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given unlabeled data and must find patterns and relationships on its own. Semi-supervised learning is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning, where the algorithm is given both labeled and unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with its environment and learning through trial and error to maximize rewards or minimize penalties.\\n\\nMachine learning has applications in various industries, including finance, healthcare, marketing, and transportation, among others. It is used to analyze data, make predictions, and automate decision-making processes. Machine learning models can be trained on large datasets using powerful computers and cloud infrastructure, enabling them to learn from vast amounts of data and improve their accuracy over time.\\n\\nSome popular machine learning algorithms include:\\n\\n* Linear Regression\\n* Logistic Regression\\n* Decision Trees\\n* Random Forests\\n* Support Vector Machines (SVM)\\n* Neural Networks\\n* Naive Bayes\\n* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\\n* Gradient Boosting\\n* Ensemble Methods\\n\\nMachine learning has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work by enabling machines to learn and adapt to new situations, improving productivity, and enhancing human capabilities. However, it also raises important ethical and societal issues related to privacy, bias, and fairness, which must be addressed to ensure that machine learning is used in a responsible and ethical manner.'"

We can do this very simply but you would need to start using neural networks when you have a neural network that is completely unrelated to you to create a solution. And how exactly do you do that is something that you are not using to solve those problems. But this requires that each of these systems have a certain kind of neural model of how they are going to interact, and then they can start talking about which systems they know how to find.\\nBut what do we actually mean by that?
